# OAuth 2.0 Client Example

This is a demonstration of how to obtain an access token to call Brightspace
APIs on behalf of a user via the [authorization code grant
flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4).

## How to run this sample

This sample is not production-ready as-is, and is meant to only run locally.

### Pre-requisites

This sample uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and it must be installed before
proceeding.

Use `https://localhost:3001/callback` when providing the redirect URI during
application registration.

### Environment variables

These environment variables must be set:

* CLIENT_ID
  * The OAuth 2.0 client ID (available from the [Brightspace OAuth 2.0
    registration page](http://docs.valence.desire2learn.com/basic/oauth2.html))
* CLIENT_SECRET
  * The OAuth 2.0 client secret (available from the [Brightspace OAuth 2.0
    registration page](http://docs.valence.desire2learn.com/basic/oauth2.html))
* HOST_URL
  * The URL of the Brightspace instance (e.g.
    `https://myschool.brightspace.com`)

A file named `.env` with the following structure can be used to automatically
set environment variables:

```
CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>
HOST_URL=<host_url>
```

### Running the sample

Run the following:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then navigate to `https://localhost:3001/`.
